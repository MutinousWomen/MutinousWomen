                        <h4>Joan DeJean</h4>   
                    

                        <p class="text-muted"> Joan DeJean was born in Opelousas, Louisiana.  She was educated at Tulane (Newcomb College) and Yale University.  She taught courses on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France at Yale, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, where she is Trustee Professor.  She has done research in French archives since 1974, primarily in the archives of Parisian prisons held in Paris’s Arsenal Library.  It was in the Arsenal that, a decade ago, she came across the earliest documentation describing the arrests and deportations of the Mutinous Women who helped found and build New Orleans.
