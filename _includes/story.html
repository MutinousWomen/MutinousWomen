            In 1719, the Parisian police force was given free rein to arrest women.  The development of the newest French colony, the immense territory known as “Louisiana,” had suddenly become a priority, and officials were willing to use any means necessary to acquire female colonists.  Any woman found on the streets of Paris was at risk of being quickly incarcerated on trumped-up charges and then shipped off across the Atlantic.  A few traveled on a vessel named Les Deux Frères, while most were transported on a ship called La Mutine, or the Mutinous Woman.  Of the hundreds arrested in police raids, roughly 188 women were taken from Paris in chains.  About 60 survived the journey.  In 1720, those survivors found themselves on the Gulf Coast.  Most soon married and began new lives all over the colony – from Natchez to Mobile, from Biloxi to Arkansas, from Natchitoches to Illinois.  During the first decade of New Orleans’s existence, at least 37 survivors resided there.  Many women deported in 1719 were among the original owners of property in what is now the French Quarter.
